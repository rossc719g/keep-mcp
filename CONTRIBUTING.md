# Contributing

Keep pull requests focused. Include regression tests for bug fixes and run
`make test` and `make lint` before submitting.

## Visual evidence

Every feature or bug-fix PR must include visual evidence that the changed
behaviour works, with screenshots at minimum. Put the screenshots in the PR
description with the steps and inputs used to reproduce the result.

Show the real MCP client prompt and actual tool invocation/result, paired with
screenshots of the corresponding Google Keep state. Prefer a CLI client when
available and quote its transcript in code blocks. Client UI screenshots are
optional. Record the client name/version and server build. An assistant's
success message alone does not prove that the operation worked.

Put test results and logs in code blocks. Screenshots of tests, terminals,
source code, or reconstructed interfaces do not satisfy the real-use
requirement. If a client cannot exercise a negative case, say so and provide its
automated regression coverage separately. Keep the PR draft while required
real-use evidence is missing.

Use the client-neutral
[keep-mcp-evidence skill](.agents/skills/keep-mcp-evidence/SKILL.md) for
scenario recipes, capture requirements and cleanup. Keep raw captures local in
`testing-evidence/`, then attach only reviewed screenshots directly to the PR.
Put relevant CLI transcripts in collapsible code blocks in the PR. Do not commit
run-specific screenshots, transcripts or reports unless explicitly requested.

Capture the failing case before the fix when practical, and the working case
after it. Videos can supplement screenshots. Remove credentials, tokens, and
private note content before uploading evidence.

Prefer a dedicated test account for Google Keep smoke tests. The smoke script is
read-only by default. `--write-fixtures` explicitly creates and updates two
disposable notes and moves them to recoverable trash. It does not hard-delete or
share anything. Existing-note writes still require the `AI` label and a current
revision, even in test accounts. Credentials belong only in macOS Keychain.
