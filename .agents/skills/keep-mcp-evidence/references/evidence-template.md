# Evidence run template

Store a filled copy locally for each run, outside version control. Omit account
identifiers and secrets. Unexecuted scenarios remain pending, never prefilled as
passed.

- Run ID and UTC time:
- PR and server commit / dirty changes:
- Client name/version and CLI or desktop mode:
- Saved prompt, invocation command and actual tool-event transcript paths:
- Server name selected in client:
- Verified launch command, interpreter, SDK version, transport:
- How the running process/build was verified:
- Browser session and account match confirmed (no email):
- AI label, explicit intent, and expected revision verified:

For each scenario:

- Fixture title and returned note ID:
- Exact prompt:
- Actual MCP tool, arguments, result/error:
- Keep starting state:
- Keep observed state after refresh/sync:
- Assertion and outcome (passed / failed / not exercised / blocked):
- Screenshot filenames and capture times:
- Cleanup action and result:

## PR excerpt

Client: <name/version>. Server: <commit and SDK>. Transport: <transport>.

Reproduction: <fixture setup, prompt and any extra sync step>.

- <Observed result supported by actual screenshots>
  <CLI prompt and actual MCP call/result in a code block, or expanded client UI capture>
  <Corresponding Google Keep screenshot>

Automated test results go in a fenced code block, copied from execution output.
State any scenario not exercised and why. Link only captures actually produced
and visually inspected. Do not leave invented image links or successful outcome
examples.
