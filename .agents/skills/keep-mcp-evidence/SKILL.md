# keep-mcp evidence

Prove the action through the actual MCP client and verify its effect
independently in Google Keep. Test output belongs in code blocks, never
screenshot substitutes. Prefer a CLI-based MCP client when available. Use the
current agent's connected MCP tools if they target the verified build, otherwise
use a bounded CLI invocation such as Codex exec or Cursor CLI. Honour the user's
client choice and record its name/version. A desktop client is a fallback, not a
requirement.

Save the exact prompt and actual MCP call/result events as text. CLI transcripts
belong in code blocks; client screenshots are optional. Google Keep screenshots
still provide the independent visual evidence. Read
[cli-runs.md](references/cli-runs.md) when using a CLI client.

## Preflight

- Read the diff and choose concrete visible outcomes. Read
  [scenarios.md](references/scenarios.md) for the checklist scenarios from PR
  #19.
- Verify the client's keep-mcp launch command resolves to the checkout/build
  under test. Record commit, dirty status, interpreter, SDK version and
  transport without logging environment values. Restart/reconnect the server
  after changes. A checked out commit alone does not establish which server an
  already-running client uses.
- If multiple Keep servers are configured, target the exact server under test
  and inspect every invocation. Do not silently fall back to another server.
- Open Google Keep in an isolated authenticated browser session when available.
  Confirm it is the same account as the configured server, without publishing
  the account identifier. Prefer a dedicated test account. If login is needed,
  leave the page open and ask the user to sign in. Continue independent
  preparation while waiting. Never request tokens/passwords in chat or copy
  browser credentials.
- Use the enforced `AI` label, explicit user intent, and expected-revision
  policy; there is no unsafe bypass. Operate only on fixtures created for this
  run, with names
  `keep-mcp-evidence-<UTC timestamp>-<random suffix>-<scenario>`. Record
  returned note IDs immediately. Keep a local manifest of IDs and cleanup
  status. Never delete unrelated notes or the shared `keep-mcp` label.

## Run and capture

1. Write down the exact prompt, expected MCP operation/arguments, expected
   visible state and timeout. Use a fresh fixture per scenario. Fixture setup
   also goes through the client when feasible; identify any separate setup
   method explicitly.
2. Plan only the Keep checkpoints needed to prove the visible outcome. Use the
   client transcript for intermediate checks. Batch independent final fixture
   checks into one scoped Keep view when readable. Capture a before state when
   needed to demonstrate a change; do not take a screenshot after every tool
   call.
3. Submit the saved prompt through the real MCP client. With a CLI, retain its
   structured tool-call events and results. With a desktop client, expand the
   tool details and capture them. An assistant's success message alone is
   insufficient.
4. Match actual arguments and returned note ID against the scenario. If the
   model corrects invalid input, substitutes another tool, or refuses to call,
   mark that negative case **not exercised**. One clarified retry is reasonable;
   don't keep creating notes or replace the invocation with a Python call to
   manufacture proof.
5. In Keep, find/open the exact fixture and wait for synchronization, refreshing
   when necessary. Assert the visible title, item text and checked state. Bound
   the wait, for example to 60 seconds. A timeout is inconclusive, not proof of
   absence. For failed updates, also make a benign supported update and reload:
   this helps expose unintended cached mutations that could be synced on a later
   request. Keep the rejected update and follow-up sync in the same server
   process; a fresh CLI invocation can discard the very cached mutation this
   scenario tests.
6. Capture the resulting Keep state. Capture before-build evidence on separate
   fixtures when practical; don't confuse a starting state with reproduction on
   an old build. Never stage expected UI using browser edits or mock pages.
7. Inspect every image for legibility and private content. Frame the fixture and
   client exchange tightly, excluding unrelated notes, conversations, account
   menus and credentials. Cropping/redaction may hide private content, but must
   not alter the behavior shown. Never publish browser storage, tokens or raw
   private logs.
8. Clean up only recorded fixture IDs, preferably by moving them to recoverable
   trash through the client. Verify cleanup and record any leftover IDs. If a
   call times out, search for the unique title before retrying creation or
   cleanup.

Use browser/computer tools for Keep checkpoints and screenshot capture, not to
drive a client that has a usable CLI. Stop inspecting once a checkpoint is
clear. Use screenshots from supported browser/native capture tools. Load the
relevant browser skill when available. No generated screenshots, reconstructed
conversations, or screenshots of pytest/terminal output in place of real use.

## Delivery and reproducibility

Use [evidence-template.md](references/evidence-template.md). Keep captures and
raw observations in an ignored local `testing-evidence/<PR>/<run-id>/`
directory. The manifest records client/build, fixture IDs, prompts, actual
calls, timestamps, assertions, screenshot filenames, coverage gaps and cleanup.
Never include secrets. Publish only reviewed screenshots and selected
non-sensitive facts to the requested PR when authorized. Attach screenshots
directly to the PR and quote decisive CLI output in collapsible code blocks in
its description or a comment. Keep run-specific screenshots, transcripts and
reports out of version control unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. Do
not create a repository evidence folder as an upload workaround. If attachments
are blocked, preserve the files locally and report the blocker. Offer the files
for manual attachment instead of escalating into desktop automation. Reusable
recipes belong in the skill; individual run results belong in the PR.

If login, client access or build provenance is unavailable, report the exact
blocker, leave the PR draft, and preserve the recipe for resumption. Do not mark
the screenshot requirement satisfied or substitute automated tests. A skill
passing static validation is not evidence that the live workflow has passed.
